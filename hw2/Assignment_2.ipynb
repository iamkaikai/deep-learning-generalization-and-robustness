    "## Assignment 2: Adversarial Training\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment requires you to create adversarial examples. You will do adversarial training, i.e., train the model with sets of adversarial examples you generated and evaluate the performances of the model on test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Adversarial Training?\n",
    "Adversarial training is a machine learning technique to improve models' robustness by training them on adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are input data that has been intentionally modified to cause the model to misclassify or produce an incorrect output. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a model is trained using adversarial examples, it becomes more resilient to adversarial attacks and is able to better identify and classify input data that may have been modified or corrupted. This may lead to improved performance of the model in real-world scenarios where the input data may not always be perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, adversarial training can also have some negative impacts on ML models. For example, it can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the particular adversarial examples used in training and is unable to generalize well to new examples. Additionally, adversarial training can increase the computational requirements of training the model due to the need for generating adversarial examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while adversarial training can improve the robustness of ML models, it is important to carefully consider its potential benefits and drawbacks and to evaluate the trade-offs in terms of model performance and computational requirements. The following are the steps involved in adversarial training:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate adversarial examples: In the first step, we generate adversarial examples by perturbing the original data points in such a way that the modifications are small and not noticeable to humans but are enough to cause misclassification by the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train on adversarial examples: In the second step, we train the neural network on adversarial examples in addition to the original training data. This helps to improve the network's ability to recognize and classify adversarial examples correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluate performance: In the third step, we evaluate the performance of the network on both the original and adversarial test data. This helps to determine if the adversarial training has improved the network's robustness against adversarial attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, adversarial training is a powerful technique that can help improve the security and reliability of deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Homework, you will run different adversarial training algorithms on the ResNet18 model with the adversarial examples, and evaluating the model performances on test data. The goal is to get experience in generating adversarial examples and train the model with these examples, i.e., adversarial training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided the model architecture ($\\texttt{model.py}$) and some pre-defined functions ($\\texttt{utils.py}$) so you can import and use them directly in the notebook."

Homework discussions are allowed only on Piazza, according to the policy outlined on the course web page: [https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/63219](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/63219). You are not allowed to search online for auxiliary software, reference models, architecture specifications, or additional data to solve the homework assignment. Your submission must be entirely your own work. That is, the code and the answers that you submit must be created, typed, and documented by you alone, based exclusively on the materials discussed in class, and released with the homework assignment. You can obviously consult the class slides posted in Canvas, your lecture notes, and the textbook. Important: the models you will submit for this homework assignment must be\n",
